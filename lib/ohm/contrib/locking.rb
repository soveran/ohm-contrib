module Ohm
  # This module is a straight extraction from Ohm. The only difference is
  # that this allows for a custom sleep value.
  # In addition, since future ohm versions might drop mutexes, I thought it
  # might be a good idea to preseve this feature as a drop-in module.
  module Locking
    # Public: Lock the object before executing the block, and release it once the block is done.
    # 
    # Examples:
    #
    #   post = Order.create(:customer => Customer.create)
    #   post.mutex(0.01) do
    #     # this block is in a mutex!
    #   end
    def mutex(wait = 0.1)
      lock!(wait)
      yield
      self
    ensure
      unlock!
    end

  protected
    # Lock the object so no other instances can modify it.
    # This method implements the design pattern for locks
    # described at: http://code.google.com/p/redis/wiki/SetnxCommand

    # @see Model#mutex
